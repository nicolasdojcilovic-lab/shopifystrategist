# DECISIONS.md (v1.0)

## Purpose
Human-owned decisions that must NOT live in generated files (e.g. SSOT_INDEX.md).
This is the canonical place to resolve SSOT conflicts, clarify ambiguities, and record governance rulings.

## Rules
- Never edit generated files to store decisions.
- Every decision must be actionable: it must name a winner and list patch targets.
- If a decision affects requirements, update TRACEABILITY_MATRIX.md accordingly.

## Decision format
Each decision is a block with:
- DecisionID (DEC-###)
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Topic
- Context
- Sources in conflict (file + anchor)
- Decision (winner + short ruling)
- Patch targets (what files must change)
- Status (Proposed / Approved)
- Owner
